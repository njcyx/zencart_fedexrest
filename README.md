### Developer Resources

- [Authorization API](https://developer.fedex.com/api/en-mx/catalog/authorization/v1/docs.html)
- [Rates API](https://developer.fedex.com/api/en-mx/catalog/rate.html#/api)


This module uses [FedEx's RESTful API](https://developer.fedex.com/api/en-mx/catalog.html).

As such, it replaces the [FedEx Web Services plugin](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1784), which was based on the (now deprecated) older Web Services XML API.
